Why..... What are you trying to accomplish?
Why not just let me be, happy with my
blocks? I don't understand..... What have I
ever done to you?$
Does my torment bring you pleasure? Do you
want to see me depressed and heartbroken?$
You are a true villian, your chubby face
and disgusting stench are as repulsive as
your twisted mind.$
No..... I can't allow this brainless baboon
to stop me.... Do you know what I did to 
those insane assylum workers who tried to 
seperate me from my honey boos.$
They died, by the hands of me. Oh... The
great joy I felt, knowing that they could
no longer stand in my way, for my love is
just too strong.$
You will suffer the same fate as those
workers. No longer, will I hold back on
my powers.$
Once I defeat you, I will nail your 
lard-filled body on my wall, as a reminder
to me and my blocks that nobody can stop
our love.&
