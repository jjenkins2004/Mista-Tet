The blocks of magnitude and monotony, where
order is unknown and chaos is my playground.
The unsuspecting relentlessly fall prey 
to my mastery. $
My mind is a never-ending grid, a labyrinth 
of blocks and lines where the whispers
of the pieces are my commands, the crashes
of the lines my symphony.$
DEFEAT is unwelcomed and unimaginable to 
Mista Tet, despite the bravest and strongest 
who have come to face me.$
The name of Mista Tet is known by kings 
and wisemen, for I bear the spear of death 
and defeat and it pierces the steel armor
of the heroic.$
No mortal hath survived to lay their two 
fragile eyes on the score of 100,000, for
I, the immovable wall, have been built so 
no one shall see it.$
Face me if you dare, or leave with 
your life and dignity...&
