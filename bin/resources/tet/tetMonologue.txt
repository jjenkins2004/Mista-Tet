Ah, so you've finally made it to my lair.
Welcome, welcome! I am Mista Tet, the smartest 
man alive, who sees colors and shapes beyond
this dimension.$
My life revolves around the great, colorful
blocks. I dream about the blocks, I care for
the blocks. I don't usually tell others this,
but... I'm actually in LOVE with the blocks!$
Oh what? I can see the judgement in your ugly
eyes, LACKING in color unlike my amazing
blocks. It honestly seems like you're just
jealous of the love I share with my blocks.$
It MUST be because you're a lonely, sad,
pathetic creep. Mhhhh... Do you need a hug?$
JUST KIDDING IDIOT! I would never want to
touch that disgusting greasy scaly skin 
of yours. I guess its no suprise you're
unloved.$
You're just like those insane asylum workers,
jealous of me, trying to take me away from
my precious blocks. Ohhh.... Oh my beautiful
blocks.... OHHHHHH.....$
You... YOU... DONT'T you dare try and take 
me away from my beloved blocks...$
My cherished blocks are mine and mine alone!
And any ugly idiot (you) who stands in my
way will DIE!!!!!&
