# Mista Tet (IN PROGRESS)

A personal remake of Tetris, where there are "powerup" orbs that spawn to aid your fight against a villain named Mista Tet.

## Motivation

I wanted something to keep me busy over the summer while also applying the C++ fundamentals that I learned in university. Therefore, I thought that working on a personal project would be a perfect fit. This marks my first attempt at a large-scale project, so my class and file organization could do with some improvement. Besides that, I am quite content and happy with my solutions to some of the roadblocks that I have faced, such as getting the game logic to work properly, how to implement each "update frame" function for different classes, etc.
