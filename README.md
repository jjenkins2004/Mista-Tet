# Mista Tet

A personal remake of Tetris, where there are power-up balls that spawn to aid your fight against a villain named Mista Tet. Click on these powerups to collect them, but be careful, as some of these have tradeoffs that could help you or cost you the game. Some powerups will be collected and will immediately be used while others will go into your power-up storage. If your powerup storage is full, then newly collected powerups will disappear, but powerups that don't need storage will still have an effect.

The game will get progressively more challenging as blocks move faster and Tet uses stronger powerups more frequently. On the other hand, powerups will spawn more frequently as the game progresses, so be sure to use these wisely to defeat Tet.

Try to get your score to 100,000 as fast as possible to defeat Tet.
